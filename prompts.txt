Project Title: Full-Stack Product Feedback Board

Overall Objective:
Create a full-stack web application that functions as a public product feedback board. Users should be able to submit feedback, view all submitted feedback sorted by popularity, upvote feedback items, and comment on them.

Technology Stack
Frontend: React (using Vite for setup) with simple CSS for styling. No complex UI libraries are needed.

Backend: Node.js with Express.js.

Database: SQLite.

API: Create a RESTful API for communication between the frontend and backend.

Backend (Server) Requirements
1. Database Schema (SQLite)
Define three tables:

feedback table:

id: INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT

title: TEXT NOT NULL

description: TEXT NOT NULL

user_email: TEXT NOT NULL

created_at: TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP

upvotes table:

id: INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT

feedback_id: INTEGER, FOREIGN KEY (feedback_id) REFERENCES feedback(id)

user_email: TEXT NOT NULL

UNIQUE (feedback_id, user_email) to enforce one vote per user per item.

comments table:

id: INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT

feedback_id: INTEGER, FOREIGN KEY (feedback_id) REFERENCES feedback(id)

user_email: TEXT NOT NULL

comment_text: TEXT NOT NULL

created_at: TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP

2. API Endpoints
Implement the following RESTful API endpoints:

GET /api/feedback

Action: Fetches all feedback items.

Logic: For each feedback item, calculate the total upvote count and the total comment count.

Response: Return a JSON array of feedback objects. Each object should include id, title, description, user_email, created_at, upvote_count, and comment_count. The entire list must be sorted by upvote_count in descending order.

POST /api/feedback

Action: Submits a new feedback item.

Request Body: { "title": "string", "description": "string", "user_email": "string" }

Validation:

Ensure title, description, and user_email are not empty.

Validate that user_email is in a proper email format.

Response: Return the newly created feedback object with a 201 Created status code.

POST /api/feedback/:id/upvote

Action: Adds an upvote to a specific feedback item.

Request Body: { "user_email": "string" }

Logic:

Check if the user's email has already upvoted this feedback ID in the upvotes table.

If not, add a new entry to the upvotes table.

If they have already voted, return an error.

Response: On success, return a success message and the new total upvote count. On failure (already voted), return a 409 Conflict status with an error message.

POST /api/feedback/:id/comments

Action: Adds a comment to a specific feedback item.

Request Body: { "user_email": "string", "comment_text": "string" }

Validation: Ensure user_email and comment_text are not empty.

Response: Return the newly created comment object.

GET /api/feedback/:id/comments

Action: Fetches all comments for a specific feedback item.

Response: Return a JSON array of all comments for the given feedback_id, sorted by created_at (oldest first).

Frontend (Client) Requirements
1. Main View (Feedback List)
Layout:

At the top, display a form to submit new feedback. The form should have fields for Title, Description, and User Email.

Below the form, display the list of all feedback items fetched from the backend.

Feedback Item Display:

Each item in the list must clearly display its title, description, upvote count, and comment count.

Each item must have an "Upvote" button.

Functionality:

Sorting: The list must be automatically displayed sorted by upvote count (most popular first).

Submission: Submitting the form should call the POST /api/feedback endpoint and refresh the feedback list to show the new entry.

Input Validation: Implement basic frontend validation (e.g., required fields, email format) before submitting.

2. Upvoting Interaction
When a user clicks the "Upvote" button on an item, prompt them to enter their email address (a simple prompt() dialog is sufficient).

Use this email to call the POST /api/feedback/:id/upvote endpoint.

Update the UI to reflect the new upvote count.

If the API returns an error (e.g., already voted), display an alert to the user.

3. Comments View (Modal or Separate Page)
Clicking on a feedback item's title or a "View Comments" button should open a view to see and add comments for that specific item.

Display: Show the selected feedback item's full title and description at the top. Below it, list all existing comments (fetched from GET /api/feedback/:id/comments), showing the commenter's email and the comment text.

Add Comment Form: Include a simple form with fields for User Email and Comment Text to allow users to add new comments. Submitting this form should call POST /api/feedback/:id/comments and refresh the comment list.

General Instructions
Project Structure: Organize the project into two main folders: /client for the React app and /server for the Node.js/Express app.

Error Handling: Implement basic error handling. The backend should return appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 400 for bad input, 404 for not found), and the frontend should display user-friendly messages or alerts for these errors.

User Perspective: Ensure the entire workflow is intuitive from a user's perspective. A user should be able to land on the page, understand how to add feedback, and how to interact with existing feedback without confusion.

the ui is very plain and simple, make it more pleasing.
